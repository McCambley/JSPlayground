# Slide on Scroll

## Overview

This project explores window events in order to create a feature where photos only display when they appear within the viewport. This is a widespread feature, but is difficult to get right in a way that doesn't hamper the UX of the page. This project attempts to add style and functionality all in one.

## How to Use

Scroll the images and pay close attention to how the photos appear. Click on a photo to display the image in full.

## Additions to Wes's Version

Wes added lots of functionality and made it super easy to follow along. I added a few things on top of this project in order to make it my own.

- Eventually, I'll create a functionality that creates a photo popup to display each image in more detail

## Goals for Future Iterations

The project is functional as is, but there are always improvements to be made.

- Image Popup
- Javascript Functionality (the primary goal of this project)
- A slider to zoom in on the grid
