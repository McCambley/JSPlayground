## All Projects

### [🎛 Drum kit](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/drum-kit/index.html)

- An exploration of using keypress event listeners to affect audio playback

### [🕐 Clock](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/clock/index.html)

- Utilizing the Date() function to update the rotational position of lines on a page in order to make a functional clock.

### [📍 CSS Variables in Javascript](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/variables/index.html)

- After all this time this project explores the use of form inputs to affect CSS variables in real time

### [🏃‍♀️ Array Cardio](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/JSCardio1/index.html)

- A tough workout on the track, practicing array functions in the console

### [🪟 Flex Panel Gallery](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/panels/index.html)

- A CSS heavy display of javascript magic using flex panels and click events

### [⌨️ Type Ahead](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/type-ahead/index.html)

- Live searching through an array of cities using regular expressions to affect DOM manipulations

### [🏃🏼‍♂️ Array Cardio](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/JSCardio2/index.html)

- Another tough workout on the track, practicing more array functions in the console

### [🖼 Canvas](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/canvas/index.html)

- Creating works of art with Canvas elements, altering stroke size and color with each move of the mouse

### [🔦 Dev Tools Discover](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/inspect-tools/)

- Learning more ins and outs of the browser developer tools feature

### [☑️ Checkboxes](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/checkboxes/)

- Building a list of checkbox inputs that allows users to select multiple options while holding down shift, a common feature throughout the web.

### [📽 Custom Video Player](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/custom-video-player/)

- Creating custom video controls to mimic and build upon the default browser options. This project went a few steps beyond what Wes Bos had displayed in his own project in order to add functionality commonly seen in todays most popular video players.

### [🔗 Key Sequence Detector](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/sequence/)

- Listen for a sequence of keys and alert the user if they type the secret code. This project uses the same functionality as the popular "Konami Code" easter egg featured on many website homepages.

### [🎚 Slide on Scroll](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/slide-on-scroll/)

- Listen for scroll events and display photos only when they appear in the window. This project features a popup that lets users view an expanded version of each photo as well.

### [📜 Javascript References](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/objects-and-arrays/)

- Use a reduce function to calculate the total time left in a video series.

### [🔐 Local Storage and Event Delegations](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/local-storage/)

- Create a list of menu items that will remain in their added and checked/unchecked state on page refresh. Also, use event delegation to target specific menu items on click in order to set certain Local Storage variable values.

- What's next is to implement a clear button that will reset the menu, the local storage, and the innerHTML of the plates list.

- This project will be especially useful in maintaining a "dark mode" state on page refresh on a separate project, my personal portfolio.

### [🐭 Mouse Move Shadow](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/mouse-move-shadow/)

- Capture moment to moment location data from the mousemove event in order to create a fancy text shadow that moves with the mouse.

### [🗞 Sort Without Articles](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/sort-without-articles/)

- Sort a list of bandnames without articles using an assortment of array methods and regular expressions.

### [⏰ Adding Up Times with Reduce](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/add-times/)

- Use a reduce function to calculate the total time left in a video series.

### [📸 Webcam Fun](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/webcam-fun/)

- Returning to practice in the console except this time we're working with objects and object references.

### [🗣 Speech Detection](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/speech-detection/)

- Use the speech recognition Api to capture speech from users and render words into a chat message

### [👣 Follow Along Link Highlighter](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/follow-along/)

- The beginnings of a stripe menu reconstruction, we'll build a travelling highlight box that will follow the mouse and appear behind certain words in order to add emphasis.

### [🎙 Speech Synthesis](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/speech-synthesis/)

- Whereas previosuly we were capturing voice, now we're utilizing the SpeechSynthesis Api to generate voice based on text.
- Users may alter the speaker, speed, pitch, and content of the voice

### [⬇️ Follow Along Menu](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/follow-along-dropdown/)

- The full reproduction of the Stripe Menu. This project features a moving navbar that will populate with content depending on what nav link is currently in focus.

### [⚓️ Click and Drag](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/click-and-drag/)

- Mimicking touchscreen scrolling, this project augments a users ability to scroll horizontally in an overflowing container and allows them to drag the content to a new position by clicking and holding the mouse down.

### [📽 Video Speed Controller](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/video-speed-control/)

- The project features a fancy custom slider input which can adjust the speed of an adjacent video.
- When the video speed changes, the text content of the slider will adjsut accordingly.

### [⏳ Countdown Timer](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/countdown-timer/)

- A rather useful project, this project is a simple yet powerful timer which provides default and custom options for countdowns. When the timer is complete, a success image is displayed.

### [🎯 Target Striker](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/projects/targets/)

- A fun game similar to whack-a-mole in which a user can choose their preferred difficulty then see how many moving targets they can catch before their ten seconds are up.
