# JS Dreamland

## A project comprised of some littler projects, all geared towards practicing front-end development with Javascript.

# [Projects](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/)

### [🎛 Drum kit](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/drum-kit/index.html)

- An exploration of using keypress event listeners to affect audio playback

### [🕐 Clock](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/clock/index.html)

- Utilizing the Date() function to update the rotational position of lines on a page in order to make a functional clock.

### [📍 CSS Variables in Javascript](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/variables/index.html)

- After all this time this project explores the use of form inputs to affect CSS variables in real time

### [🏃‍♀️ Array Cardio](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/JSCardio1/index.html)

- A tough workout on the track, practicing array functions in the console

### [🪟 Flex Panel Gallery](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/panels/index.html)

- A CSS heavy display of javascript magic using flex panels and click events

### [⌨️ Type Ahead](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/type-ahead/index.html)

- Live searching through an array of cities using regular expressions to affect DOM manipulations

### [🏃🏼‍♂️ Array Cardio](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/JSCardio2/index.html)

- Another tough workout on the track, practicing more array functions in the console

### [🖼 Canvas](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/canvas/index.html)

- Creating works of art with Canvas elements, altering stroke size and color with each move of the mouse

### [🔦 Dev Tools Discover](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/inspect-tools/)

- Learning more ins and outs of the browser developer tools feature

### [☑️ Checkboxes](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/checkboxes/)

- Building a list of checkbox inputs that allows users to select multiple options while holding down shift, a common feature throughout the web.

### [📽 Custom Video Player](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/custom-video-player/)

- Creating custom video controls to mimic and build upon the default browser options. This project went a few steps beyond what Wes Bos had displayed in his own project in order to add functionality commonly seen in todays most popular video players.

### [🔗 Key Sequence Detector](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/sequence/)

- Listen for a sequence of keys and alert the user if they type the secret code. This project uses the same functionality as the popular "Konami Code" easter egg featured on many website homepages.

### [🎚 Slide on Scroll](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/slide-on-scroll/)

- Listen for scroll events and display photos only when they appear in the window. This project features a popup that lets users view an expanded version of each photo as well.

### [🔐 Local Storage and Event Delegations](https://mccambley.github.io/JSPlayground/local-storage/)

- Create a list of menu items that will remain in their added and checked/unchecked state on page refresh. Also, use event delegation to target specific menu items on click in order to set certain Local Storage variable values.

- What's next is to implement a clear button that will reset the menu, the local storage, and the innerHTML of the plates list

- This project will be especially useful in maintaining a "dark mode" state on page refresh on a separate project, my personal portfolio.

### To-do

- So many projects!
- Add a link box in the bottom of the homepage
