# Custom Video Player

## Overview

This one's cool, I like this one. We removed the default controls and used some funky yet basic CSS to get custom controls up in there. Javascript is used to link the inputs to the video playback such that we can manipulate the video just as we would be with the default controls.

## Future Ideas

- I'd like to take this project a step further and combine some old functionality from previous projects in order to update the volume and playback speeds more smoothly.

- I'd also like to add a few radio buttons in order to allow for users to change which video they're viewing. I can't chose which video of my dog to display and I'd like to be able to see all of them. Learning in order to enable my indecision. Amazing.

- Change volume with up and down arrows

- Adjust shadow progress bar on mousemove so that you may see where you'll fast forward to
