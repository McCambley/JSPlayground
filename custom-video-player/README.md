# Custom Video Player

## Overview

This one's cool, I like this one. We removed the default controls and used some funky yet basic CSS to get custom controls up in there. Javascript is used to link the inputs to the video playback such that we can manipulate the video just as we would be with the default controls.

## Additions to Wes's Version

Wes added lots of functionality and made it super easy to follow along. I added a few things on top of this project in order to make it my own.

- Hovering over the progress bar shows a preview of the progress bars appearance at the hover point

- Scrolling the range inputs updates the values in real time rather than on release

- Pausing the video displays a header and playing the video hides the header from view

- Selecting values from the drop down menu on the header allows users to change which video they are viewing
